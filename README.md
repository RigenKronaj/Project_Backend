# Project_Backend

The Backend part of the final project for ASDEV

So far, there is functionality for reading data from a CSV file and parsing it into a JSON
in order to be fetched and processed by the Frontend application. Additionally, there is
functionality to add, remove, edit, and filter the results gathered from this file.

There are other functionalities that I wish to add by the end of the project's deadline.
